            EVA is a wearable device that is designed to detect abnormalities in breast thermal patterns and tissue elasticity, which can be strong indicators of early stage breast cancer. It consists of two biosensing patches that the user can place on her own brasier.
          </p>
          <p class="eva-description higia-font-helveticaneue-thin">
            The patches collect data that is sent to the user’s phone or tablet through bluetooth technology, and our Artificial Intelligence algorithms produce a risk assessment within minutes.
