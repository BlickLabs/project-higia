            EVA is a wearable device that is designed to detect abnormalities in breast thermal patterns and tissue elasticity, which can be strong indicators of early stage breast cancer. It consists of two biosensing patches that the user can place on her own brasier.
          </p>
          <p class="eva-description">
            The patches collect data that is sent to the userâ€™s phone or tablet through bluetooth technology, and our Artificial Intelligence algorithms produce a risk assessment within minutes.

These blood vessel formations are distinguishable from those naturally occurring in the body, and hence breast cancer risk can be assessed by detecting the thermal patterns associated with them.</p>
