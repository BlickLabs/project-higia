00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.080
1.7 million women 
will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
The second most common
cause of death in women

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.100
Tell me...

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.000
Would you trust the life of your most 
loved, in a method like auto-exploration?

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.540
WE DON'T

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.800
When I was 13 years old, my mother was
diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.360
The tumor grew from the size of a grain of rice
to that of a golf ball in less than 6 months.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.860
The diagnosis came in too late, and my 
mother lost both breasts, and nearly lost her life.

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.500
In her own words:
She felt mutilated by this disease

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.620
And all this pain and suffering,
result of a late diagnostic due to the 
fallibility of current breast cancer-detecting methods.

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300
This is how EVA is born.

12
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.640
EVA is the first bra of its kind.

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.020
It is equipped with tactile, temperature, and light sensors.

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.540
A woman uses EVA between 60-90 minutes a week,

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.700
to monitor her breasts' health periodically

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.760
And so,

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.460
giving a precise diagnostic about them.

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.760
All significative information, with respect to breast color, texture and temperature,

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.820
is sent by bluetooth to our mobile and web apps

20
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.640
Finally, our health algorithms analyze the information,  with the help of neural networks.

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.020
A weekly diagnostic is output, which is instantly sent to the woman, and her personal oncologist.

22
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.600
It reduces time gaps by up to a 95%.

23
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.060
By doing so,

24
00:01:40.300 --> 00:00:00.000
saves millions of lives.
